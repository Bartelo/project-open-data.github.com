Open Data Appendix
==================


1. Background
-------------
The federal government needs to  manage its data as the asset it really is; an open asset for every American just like roads or natural resources. The intent is that this policy is a broad government wide approach to ensure federal information is collected, managed and published in such a way as to reduce barrier to access by itself, other agencies and the public.  Open, means there is no barrier to consumption of an information asset.  

From financial statistics to agriculture production and from human health to air quality, the Federal Government collects and produces large amount of data.  In today’s digital society, government data has become an essential part of daily life – everyday Americans obtain weather information before they leave home and rely on data from the Global Positioning System (GPS) when they get on the road.  Just as more and more private companies consider data as a corporate asset, the Federal Government must view government data as a national asset.  Towards this end, the Federal Government launched Data.gov in 2009 to publish agency data sets, and today more than 2,500 data sets are available for download.

Despite this progress, vast amounts of government data are still locked in internal data stores. When data is released, it is often published in closed formats that limit data discoverability and accessibility.  More critically, open data practices have not been institutionalized in many Federal agencies even as the stores of government data continue to grow.  Too often, agencies build systems that are not architected to maximize interoperability and support open data needs.  To further unleash the power of government data, it is imperative to establish a government-wide open data policy that institutionalizes and operationalizes open data practices.  In doing so, the Federal Government can achieve several important objectives including spurring the economy, increasing transparency, improving service to customers, and saving taxpayer dollars through increased efficiencies.

This Appendix was purposefully developed as gitHub pages so that real collaboration and input could help us make our open data policy better.  Please suggest enhancements by editing the content here.  We fully intent to make this a living collaboration for continued open data.
